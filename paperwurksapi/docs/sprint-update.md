## ðŸ“Š Updated Timeline Impact

### Original Timeline

- 12 weeks (6 sprints)
- EPIC-002: 1 sprint (2 weeks)

### Updated Timeline

- 14 weeks (7 sprints)
- EPIC-002A: 1 sprint (2 weeks)
- EPIC-002B: 1 sprint (2 weeks)
- Integration: Carried into Sprint 2

### Rationale for Change

1. **Identity is foundational** - All other apps depend on it
2. **Complexity underestimated** - 6 models (Identity, Entity, Role, Permission, ACL, Profile) + middleware + service layer
3. **Integration critical** - Property, Pack, Document, Feedback all need permission checks
4. **Audit requirements** - Every permission change must be logged
5. **TDD approach** - Comprehensive testing adds development time

### Risk Mitigation

- **Risk:** Timeline extended by 2 weeks
- **Mitigation:** Identity completion enables parallel development in later sprints
- **Benefit:** Solid IAM foundation prevents rework and security issues

---

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Review and approve updated sprint plan
2. **Week 3:** Begin Sprint 1A (Identity Core)
3. **Week 5:** Begin Sprint 1B (Authorization)
4. **Week 7:** Begin Sprint 2 (Property + Identity Integration)
5. **Post-Sprint 2:** Review integration points and adjust remaining epics if needed

---

## Notes for Development Team

### Sprint 1A Focus

- Start with Identity and Entity models (most critical)
- Authentication flows are well-understood (lower risk)
- Profile can be implemented last in sprint

### Sprint 1B Focus

- Role/Permission system is complex (allocate extra time)
- ACL model requires careful design (many edge cases)
- Middleware must be thoroughly tested (affects all endpoints)
- Service API design is critical for other teams

### Technical Debt Prevention

- Document all permission codenames as they're created
- Write integration tests for permission checks
- Create permission checking utilities/decorators
- Maintain audit log integrity
